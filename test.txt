 1) Project Description

  ChainScope AI is a smart contract security auditor powered by generative UI. It lets developers paste their Solidity code and get an instant, visual security audit — complete with vulnerability cards, severity scores, inline diff views showing vulnerable vs fixed code, and a
  full corrected contract ready to copy.

  Built with Next.js 16, React 19, and Tambo AI, the app goes beyond plain text responses. Every audit finding is rendered as a rich, interactive UI component — animated severity badges, a circular security score gauge, GitHub-style code diffs, and a one-click copyable fixed
  contract. The glassmorphism design with animated aurora backgrounds makes the experience feel polished and professional.

  The goal is simple: make smart contract security accessible. Instead of reading through walls of text from traditional audit tools, developers get a clear, visual breakdown of exactly what's wrong, why it matters, and how to fix it.

  2) YouTube Video Demo Script (under 3 mins)

  You'll need to record this yourself, but here's a script/outline:

  [0:00–0:30] About the Project
  "Hey, I'm Omkar. I built ChainScope AI — a smart contract security auditor that uses generative UI to turn audit reports into rich, interactive components. Instead of getting a wall of text, you get visual severity cards, security score gauges, code diffs, and a complete fixed
  contract — all generated in real-time."

  [0:30–1:00] Tech Stack & Architecture
  "The tech stack is Next.js 16 with React 19 and TypeScript. For the generative UI, I'm using Tambo AI — it lets the LLM decide which UI components to render based on the conversation. I defined 8 custom components with Zod schemas, and Tambo streams them in real-time. The UI
  uses Framer Motion for animations, Prism React Renderer for syntax highlighting, and a custom glassmorphism design system."

  [1:00–2:30] Demo
  - Show the landing page with the aurora background
  - Click "Load Sample Vulnerable Contract"
  - Click "Audit" and show the streaming response
  - Point out: ScanningIndicator, AuditSummaryCard with issue breakdown, VulnerabilityCards with inline diffs, SecurityScoreMeter gauge, FixedContractCard with copy button
  - Click "Copy Code" on the fixed contract
  - Highlight how each component is generated by the AI, not hardcoded

  [2:30–3:00] Learnings
  "Building this taught me a lot about making LLM outputs resilient — LLMs don't always return perfect data, so every component needs defensive defaults. I also learned how generative UI bridges the gap between AI capabilities and user experience. Instead of the user parsing
  text, the AI renders the right component for the right context."

  3) How I Used Tambo in My Project

  I used Tambo AI as the core engine that powers ChainScope AI's generative UI experience. Here's how:

  Component Registry: I registered 8 custom React components with Tambo — VulnerabilityCard, AuditSummaryCard, SecurityScoreMeter, CodeDiffViewer, FixSuggestionCard, ScanningIndicator, SafeContractCard, and FixedContractCard. Each component has a Zod schema defining its props,
  which Tambo uses to understand what data each component needs.

  Real-time Streaming: When a user submits a contract for audit, Tambo streams the AI's response in real-time. The LLM decides which components to render and with what data — for example, it renders a ScanningIndicator first, then an AuditSummaryCard with the issue breakdown,
  followed by individual VulnerabilityCards for each finding, a SecurityScoreMeter with the overall score, and finally a FixedContractCard with the corrected code.

  Tool Integration: I defined custom Tambo tools like analyze_contract, explain_vulnerability, and generate_fix that the LLM can call during the conversation to perform pattern-based vulnerability detection and generate fix suggestions.

  System Instructions: Using Tambo's initialMessages prop, I provided the LLM with specific audit workflow rules — like ensuring every counted issue gets its own VulnerabilityCard, including both vulnerable and fixed code for inline diffs, and always ending with a complete fixed
  contract.

  Tambo essentially turns ChatGPT-style text responses into a full visual audit dashboard, generated dynamically for each contract.
